#### **思路与结构 (Thought Process & Structure)**

* **直截了当 (Straight to the Point):** This answer combines the "what" and the "why" much more quickly.
    1.  **Sentence 1:** States the achievement and immediately labels it as important ("...a huge milestone for me").
    2.  **Sentence 2:** Briefly explains the background ("It was a long-term goal...") and concludes with the feeling ("...incredibly rewarding").
* This structure is perfect for Part 1, as it's quick, clear, and complete.

#### **亮点词汇/短语 (Highlight Vocabulary/Phrases)**

* **Succeeded in...:** 和 "managed to" 效果一样，强调了“成功做到了”这件事。
* **A huge milestone:** "一个重要的里程碑". This is a fantastic and very common way to describe a significant achievement.

#### **实用句型 (Useful Sentence Patterns)**

    * 用 `so` 来连接原因和结果，是英语中最基本也最重要的逻辑连接之一。
