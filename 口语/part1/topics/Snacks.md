## 答案

Hey Tianxiang! Alan here. It's great to see you today. I've had a look at the personal information you sent over – that's fantastic stuff! It gives me a much better idea of how to make these answers feel more like *you*.

So, I see you've got some questions ready on the topic of **"Snacks"**. This is a classic Part 1 topic. Let's do this!

First, I'll act as the examiner and ask you the questions. Then, I'll immediately switch roles and show you how I would answer them as a candidate aiming for that 7.5 score. Remember, the goal is simple, clear, and natural-sounding English.

Ready? Let's begin.

### **Part 1 Model Answer: Snacks**

**(Alan as Examiner): What snacks did you like to eat when you were a child?**

**(Alan as Candidate):** Oh, when I was little, I was a big fan of potato chips. I just loved how crunchy they were. Besides that, I also enjoyed some sweet biscuits my mum would buy for me, which were a perfect treat after a long day at school.

**(Alan as Examiner): Did you often eat snacks when you were young?**

**(Alan as Candidate):** I'd say fairly often, yes. It wasn't like I could eat them all day, but my parents would let me have a small snack after I finished my homework. It was a nice little reward to look forward to, maybe a few times a week.

**(Alan as Examiner): When do you usually eat snacks now?**

**(Alan as Candidate):** Nowadays, I mostly eat snacks in the afternoon when I need a break from my studies. As a computer science student, staring at a screen can be draining, so something small like a yogurt or some nuts really helps me to recharge and focus better.

**(Alan as Examiner): Do you think it is healthy for you to eat snacks?**

**(Alan as Candidate):** Well, I believe it really depends on what you eat. If my snack is a piece of fruit or some nuts, then it's definitely healthy. However, eating junk food like chips or candy all the time is probably not a good idea. For me, the key is choosing the right kind of snack.

### **✅ Answer Analysis: Why This Works**

Alright, Tianxiang, let's quickly break down why these simple answers are effective for a 7.5 score.

#### **1. 思路与结构 (Thought & Structure)**

* **直接回答 + 补充细节 (Direct Answer + Add Details):** Notice how every answer starts with a direct response (e.g., "I was a big fan of...", "I'd say fairly often..."). Then, it adds one or two extra sentences to give more information, like *why* you liked it, *when* you ate it, or *what kind* of snack it was. This is a perfect structure for Part 1. It shows you can develop your ideas.

#### **2. 亮点词汇/短语 (Highlight Vocabulary/Phrases)**

Even though the words are simple, they are very natural and effective:

* `a big fan of...`: A very common and natural way to say you like something a lot. Much better than just "I like...".
* `crunchy`: A great descriptive word for food.
* `a perfect treat`: "Treat" is a perfect word for a special snack.
* `a nice little reward`: Shows the snack had a purpose.
* `draining`: A simple but powerful word to describe feeling tired.
* `recharge`: A fantastic word that means to get your energy back.
* `junk food`: The most common and natural term for unhealthy snacks.

#### **3. 实用句型 (Useful Sentence Patterns)**

These answers use some very useful and flexible sentence patterns:

* **"When I was little, I..."**: The perfect way to start talking about the past.
* **"Nowadays, I mostly..."**: A great way to contrast the past with the present.
* **"I believe it really depends on..."**: An excellent phrase for "it depends" questions. It shows you can think about different sides of an issue.
* **"If..., then..."**: A simple conditional sentence to explain a situation and its result. (e.g., *If* my snack is fruit, *then* it's healthy).

#### **4. 连接词的使用 (Use of Connectors)**

The answers are smooth because of simple connecting words:

* **`Besides that...` / `Also...`**: Used to add another idea smoothly.
* **`However...`**: Used to show a contrast or a different point of view (e.g., healthy snacks vs. junk food).
* **`so...`**: Used to explain a result (e.g., studying is draining, *so* I need a snack).

See? You don't need big, complicated words. You just need to organize these simple ideas clearly and connect them smoothly.
