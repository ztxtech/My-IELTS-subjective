### **第一部分：核心词汇与句型 (Vocabulary & Sentence Structures)**

由于柱状图的灵活性，它的词汇库是之前所有图表的集大成者。我们重点关注最核心的**“比较”**功能。

#### **1. 描述与比较柱子的高度/长度 (Comparing Bars)**

这是柱状图最核心的技能，和表格图的“比较排序”几乎完全一样。

1.  **the highest/tallest/longest bar represents...**: **The tallest bar represents** sales in Germany, which stood at 5 million units.
2.  **the lowest/shortest bar indicates...**: **The shortest bar indicates** the number of students from Africa.

10. **The gap between...and...**: **The gap between** the two categories was negligible (可以忽略不计的).

#### **2. 精准引述数据 (Stating Specific Values)**

同样，你需要准确读出柱子顶端对应的数值。

1.  **The figure for...reached...**: **The figure for** China's GDP growth **reached** 8%.
2.  **...stood at approximately...**: The number of tourists in 2020 **stood at approximately** 2 million.
3.  **The value for...was...**: **The value for** exports from Brazil **was** just over 40 billion dollars.

6.  **The respective figures for A, B, and C were...**: **The respective figures for** beef, lamb, and chicken were 50, 22, and 70 kg per person per year.
7.  **...which was X**: The bar for 2010 shows a total of 500, **which was** the highest in the chart.

10. **The X-axis shows..., while the Y-axis represents...**: **The X-axis shows** the different countries, **while the Y-axis represents** the number of people in millions. (在引言中有时会用到)

#### **3. 描述分组/堆叠柱状图 (For Grouped/Stacked Bars)**

如果遇到更复杂的柱状图，你可以使用这些句式。

1.  **Regarding/Concerning A,...**: **Regarding** the male population, the highest number was seen in the 18-25 age group.
2.  **The pattern for A was similar to B**: **The pattern for** women across the five categories **was similar to** that for men.

### **第二部分：万能模板 (Universal Template)**

这个模板以最常见的**类别比较型柱状图**为基础，你可以根据具体情况灵活调整。

---

**【段落一：引言 - 改写题目】**

The bar chart compares `[在此处填入被比较的类别, e.g., five different countries]` in terms of `[在此处填入衡量的指标, e.g., the amount of coffee they produced]` in the year `[年份]`.

- **备选句式:**
  - The chart illustrates data on `[在此处填入衡量的指标]` for `[在此处填入被比较的类别]` over a `[X]`-year period starting from `[年份]`. (适用于时间轴柱状图)

**【段落二：概述 - 总结最显眼的 1-2 个视觉特征】**

Overall, it is immediately obvious that `[在此处填入最高的柱子代表的类别]` had by far the highest figure. In contrast, `[在此处填入最矮的柱子代表的类别]` had the lowest. It is also worth noting that `[在此处填入另一个显著特征，如：某两类的数字非常接近 / 某个类别的数字远超其他所有类别的总和]`.

- **概述技巧:** 你的眼睛第一眼看到了什么？最高的？最矮的？巨大的差距？把这些最直观的感受写下来，就是最好的概述。

**【段落三：主体段一 - 描述最重要的 1-2 个类别】**

Looking at the details, the figure for `[在此处填入最高类别]` was the most prominent, standing at approximately `[数据]`. This was significantly higher than the figure for the second-largest category, `[在此处填入第二高类别]`, which was recorded at around `[数据]`. The number for `[最高类别]` was more than `[e.g., three times]` that of `[在此处填入一个较低的类别，以作对比]`.

- **写作思路:** 先说老大，再说老二，然后可以让老大和老小对比一下，凸显差距。

**【段落四：主体段二 - 描述其余类别并进行分组比较】**

The remaining categories had considerably lower figures. `[在此处填入类别C]` and `[在此处填入类别D]` showed very similar numbers, at `[数据]` and `[数据]` respectively. The least `[e.g., popular choice / productive country]` was `[在此处填入最低类别]`, which accounted for a mere `[数据]`, the lowest figure shown in the chart.

- **写作思路:** 把剩下的“小弟们”打包处理。找一找它们之间有没有相似的，然后把最惨的那个单独拎出来说一下。
