### **第一部分：核心词汇与句型 (Vocabulary & Sentence Structures)**

#### **1. 方位感：如何描述位置 (Language of Location)**

这是地图题的写作基础。没有准确的方位描述，读者就会在你描述的“变化”中迷路。

  10. **runs through**: A river **runs through** the town from north to south. (穿过)

#### **2. 变化感：如何描述各种变化 (Language of Change)**

这是地图题的灵魂。你需要一个强大的动词库来描述各种具体的变迁。**被动语态**在这里是你的“超级武器”，因为我们更关心“什么东西被怎么样了”，而不是“谁去做的”。

**A. 新增建筑 (Additions - “无中生有”)**

1.  **was built / constructed / erected**: A new stadium **was constructed** in the south.
2.  **was added**: A new car park **was added** next to the station.

4.  **disappeared**: The small fishing port completely **disappeared**.

2.  **was narrowed**: The main road **was narrowed**.
3.  **was pedestrianised**: The main shopping street **was pedestrianised**. (变为步行街)

**E. 位置移动 (Relocation)**

1.  **was relocated to...**: The main entrance **was relocated to** the south side of the building.
2.  **was moved to...**: The bus station **was moved to** the north of the city centre.

#### **3. 时间感：如何使用时态 (Tense Usage)**

- **描述过去 (Map 1 - e.g., 1990):** 使用**一般过去时**。
  - _例句:_ In 1990, there **was** a forest in the north.
- **描述现在 (Map 2 - e.g., Today):** 使用**一般现在时**或**现在完成时**。被动语态是黄金搭档。
  - _例句 (现在完成时被动):_ The forest **has been cleared** and **replaced** by a shopping centre.
  - _例句 (一般现在时):_ Where the forest used to be, there **is** now a shopping centre.

### **第二部分：万能模板 (Universal Template)**

地图题的段落划分通常按**“区域”**来进行，这样最有逻辑性。

---

**【段落一：引言 - 改写题目】**

The two maps illustrate the principal changes that `have taken place / took place` in the area of `[在此处填入地点名称]` between `[年份1]` and `[年份2]`.

- **备选句式:**
  - The maps show the development of the town of `[地点名称]` from `[年份1]` to `[年份2]`.

**【段落二：概述 - 总结整体变化】**

Overall, it is clear that the area has undergone a dramatic transformation, evolving from a largely `[用一个词形容过去, e.g., rural / undeveloped / residential]` area into a much more `[用一个词形容现在, e.g., developed / industrial / modern]` one. The most significant changes include the `[概括一种主要的新增变化, e.g., addition of new transport infrastructure]` and the `[概括一种主要的改造或移除变化, e.g., redevelopment of the industrial zone]`.

- **概述技巧:** 用一两句话总结这个地方的“定性”变化。是变“绿”了还是变“秃”了？是更“村”了还是更“城”了？

**【段落三：主体段一 - 按区域描述变化 1】**

Looking at the `[选择一个区域，如：northern part of the town]` in more detail, the large area of farmland that existed in `[年份1]` has been completely redeveloped. For instance, a new `[新建筑]` has been constructed on this site. To the east of this, the forest has been `[变化，如：cleared]` to make way for `[新事物]`.

- **技巧:** 像一个导游，带领读者看地图的一个角落，把这个角落里发生的所有事情讲清楚。

**【段落四：主体段二 - 按区域描述变化 2 + 不变之处】**

In the `[选择另一个区域，如：southern section]`, several key changes are also evident. The main road `[变化，如：has been extended]` further to the east, leading to a new airport. The old school, which was located next to the road, has been `[变化，- e.g., converted into a library]`. One of the few features to remain unchanged is the `[未变化的建筑]`, which is still in its original location on the west bank of the river.

- **技巧:** 继续你的导览，描述地图另一部分的变化。最后，别忘了提一下**“不变之处”**，这是一个很好的加分点，能体现你观察的全面性。
