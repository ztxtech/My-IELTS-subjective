#### **3. 分数与量词 (Fractions & Quantifiers)**

用分数和量词可以替代百分比，避免重复，展现词汇的丰富性。

| 分数/量词                             | 对应的百分比     | 例句                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------------------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

#### **4. 比较与排序 (Comparing & Ranking)**

饼图作文的“概述”和“主体段”都需要比较。

- **the largest / the highest proportion/percentage** (最大比例)
  - _例句:_ **The largest proportion** of spending was on housing.
- **the smallest / the lowest proportion/percentage** (最小比例)
  - _例句:_ The chart shows that entertainment had **the smallest percentage** of the budget.
- **followed by** (其次是...)
  - _例句:_ The most popular genre was comedy, **followed by** action films.
- **in contrast / by contrast** (相反)
  - _例句:_ Undergraduates spent most of their money on accommodation. **In contrast**, postgraduates allocated the largest part of their budget to tuition fees.
- **similarly / likewise** (同样地)
  - _例句:_ In both years, food was the primary expenditure. **Similarly**, transportation costs remained the second highest.
- **more than / over** (超过)
  - _例句:_ The combined share of X and Y was **more than** 80%.
- **less than / under** (少于)
  - _例句:_ The figure for category Z was just **under** 10%.
- **while / whereas** (然而，用于对比)
  - _例句:_ The percentage for X was 40%, **while/whereas** the figure for Y was only 15%.
- **the second largest/highest** (第二大)
  - _例句:_ The **second largest** category was transportation.
- **... is X times higher than ...** (...比...高 X 倍)
  - _例句:_ The proportion of Y **is three times higher than** that of Z.

### **第二部分：万能模板 (Universal Template)**

这个模板的目的是给你一个清晰的结构。记住，这只是骨架，你需要用上面学到的词汇和句型来填充血肉，并且根据具体题目进行微调。

---

**【段落一：引言 - 改写题目】**

The pie chart(s) illustrate(s) the proportion of `[在此处填入图表衡量的内容, e.g., different types of energy sources]` in `[在此处填入地点或背景, e.g., a particular country]` in the year(s) `[在此处填入年份]`.

- **备选句式:**
  - The provided chart(s) give(s) a breakdown of `[在此处填入衡量的内容]` by percentage in `[在此处填入地点和年份]`.
  - The chart(s) compare(s) the composition of `[在此处填入衡量的内容]` in `[在此处填入年份1]` and `[在此处填入年份2]`.

**【段落二：概述 - 总结最核心的特征】**

Overall, it is immediately apparent that `[在此处填入占比最大的类别]` constituted the most significant proportion of the total. Conversely, `[在此处填入占比最小的类别]` was the least significant component. It is also noticeable that `[在此处填入另一个显著特征，例如：最大的两项加起来超过一半 / 某个类别的占比远超其他所有类别]`.

- **注意:** 概述段**千万不要**写具体的百分比数据！只写最明显、最宏观的趋势。

**【段落三：主体段一 - 描述主要类别】**

Looking at the details, `[在此处填入占比最大的类别]` accounted for the lion's share, at approximately `[X%]`. The second largest segment was `[在此处填入第二大的类别]`, which made up `[Y%]` of the total. Together, these two categories comprised `[e.g., over half / more than two-thirds / a significant majority]` of the whole `[在此处填入被描述的整体, e.g., budget / population]`.

- **技巧:** 将占比最大、最重要或者有共同点的 2-3 个类别放在一起写。

**【段落四：主体段二 - 描述次要类别并进行对比】**

In contrast, the proportions for the remaining categories were considerably smaller. `[在此处填入第三大的类别]` represented `[Z%]`, while `[在此处填入第四大的类别]` and `[在此处填入第五大的类别]` constituted similar shares, at `[A%]` and `[B%]` respectively. The least significant category, `[在此处填入最小的类别]`, was responsible for a mere `[C%]` of the total.

- **技巧:** 将剩下的类别分组描述。如果图表之间需要比较，这一段是进行对比的好地方。例如： _The figure for X in 2010 was much higher than its 2000 counterpart._
