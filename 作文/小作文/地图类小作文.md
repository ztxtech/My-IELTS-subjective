### 雅思小作文地图题模板详解

地图题通常会给出两张或多张地图，显示某个地点在不同时间点（通常是过去和现在）的变化，或者在某个时间点上，同一地点可能出现的几种规划方案。我们的任务就是描述这些变化或方案。

**文章结构：**

一篇完整的地图题作文通常包含以下四个部分：

1.  **引言 (Introduction)**
2.  **总览 (Overview)**
3.  **主体段落 (Body Paragraphs)**
    * 主体段落1：描述第一张图或某类变化
    * 主体段落2：描述第二张图或另一类变化
4.  **结论 (Conclusion)** - **注意：地图题一般不写单独的结论段**。总览段已经起到了总结的作用。

接下来，我们一个部分一个部分地详细讲解。

* X was removed to make way for Y.

**例子：**

继续 Ryemouth 村的例子（假设地图显示以下变化）：

* 现在农田变成了高尔夫球场和酒店，渔港变成了游艇码头，商店数量增加，道路拓宽，住宅区扩大。

**主体段落1：描述北部和中部变化**

**In 1995, the northern part of Ryemouth was dominated by farmland.** **However, by the present day, this vast agricultural area has been completely replaced by a large golf course and a luxury hotel.** **Similarly, the small fishing port in the centre of the village has been converted into a modern marina, indicating a shift towards tourism.** **To the west of the port, the original shops have been expanded, and several new retail outlets have been added.**

**主体段落2：描述南部和交通变化**

**Moving to the south of the village, the residential area has undergone significant expansion.** **What was once a small cluster of houses in 1995 has now grown considerably, with many more houses being built.** **The main road running through the village has also been widened to accommodate increased traffic, and a new car park has been constructed adjacent to the marina.** **Notably, the lighthouse, located on the coastline in the far south, remained largely unchanged throughout the period.**

#### 4. 结论 (Conclusion)

**注意：** 地图题通常不单独写结论段。**总览段（Overview）已经起到了总结和概括的作用。** 因此，在实际写作中，你写完主体段落即可，无需再写一个单独的结论段。如果时间不够或者篇幅已足，直接结束即可。

### 总结与建议

1.  **先看图，后动笔：** 仔细观察两张图，找出所有主要的变化点，并圈画出来。
2.  **规划结构：** 确定引言、总览、主体段落的内容，以及主体段落的划分方式。
3.  **时态和方位词：** 这是地图题的灵魂。务必准确使用过去时、现在完成时和各种方位词。
4.  **词汇多样性：** 尝试使用不同的动词和名词来描述变化，避免重复。
5.  **数据选择性：** 地图题一般没有具体数据，但如果有，也要像流程图一样，有选择地提及最重要的。
6.  **字数：** 小作文要求至少150字。按照这个模板写，通常都能达到要求。
