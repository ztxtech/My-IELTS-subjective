### **第二部分：万能模板 (Universal Template)**

这个模板专为折线图设计，重点在于描述“时间变化”和“趋势对比”。

**【段落一：引言 - 改写题目】**

The line graph illustrates `[在此处填入衡量的内容, e.g., the unemployment rates]` in `[在此处填入涉及的组群或国家, e.g., three different countries]` over a period from `[开始年份]` to `[结束年份]`.

- **备选句式:**
  - The graph provides data on `[在此处填入衡量的内容]` for `[在此处填入组群]` between `[开始年份]` and `[结束年份]`.
  - The chart compares `[在此处填入组群1]` and `[在此处填入组群2]` in terms of `[在此处填入衡量的内容]` over a `[X]`-year period.

**【段落二：概述 - 总结最核心的总体趋势】**

Overall, the most noticeable trend is that `[在此处填入线条A的总体趋势, e.g., the figure for Country A experienced a significant upward trend]`, while `[在此处填入线条B的总体趋势, e.g., Country B showed an opposite pattern]`. It is also clear that `[在此处填入另一个最显著的特征, e.g., Country C remained the most popular choice for the entire period / one line started at the highest point but finished at the lowest]`.

- **概述段黄金法则:** 只写总体趋势（是升了、降了还是波动了），不写任何具体年份和数字。

**【段落三：主体段一 - 描述第一条（或最重要的）线条】**

Focusing on `[线条A]`, it started at `[起点数据]` in `[开始年份]`. Over the next `[X]` years, it `[描述第一段趋势, e.g., rose sharply]`, reaching a peak of `[最高点数据]` in `[年份]`. Following this, the figure `[描述第二段趋势, e.g., declined gradually]`, eventually finishing at `[终点数据]` in `[结束年份]`.

- **技巧:** 像讲故事一样，描述一条线从起点到终点的“旅程”，包括它的转折点。

**【段落四：主体段二 - 描述其他线条并进行对比】**

In contrast, `[线条B]` began the period at a higher point of `[起点数据]`. However, it followed a downward trend, `[描述B的趋势, e.g., falling steadily]` to end at `[终点数据]`. Meanwhile, the figure for `[线条C]` `[描述C的趋势, e.g., fluctuated over the period]`, starting at `[起点数据]` and ending at `[终点数据]`. Notably, `[在此处加入对比句，e.g., the gap between Country A and Country B widened over time / Country C overtook Country B as the second most popular option in 2005]`.

- **技巧:** 这一段的灵魂在于**“对比”**。一定要使用`in contrast`, `similarly`, `while`, `whereas`等词汇，并明确指出线条之间的交叉、超越、差距变化等关系。
