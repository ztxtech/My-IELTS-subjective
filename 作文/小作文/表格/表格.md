### **第一部分：核心词汇与句型 (Vocabulary & Sentence Structures)**

对于表格图，你需要掌握的核心语言功能是**“比较”**和**“排序”**。

#### **1. 精准描述数据 (Stating Data Accurately)**

这是最基础的一步，即准确地引述表格中的数据。

1.  **The figure for... was...**: **The figure for** students in the UK **was** 250,000.

10. **...was the number for...**: 2.5 million **was the number for** people employed in the agricultural sector.

#### **2. 比较与排序 (Comparing and Ranking)**

**A. 表达“最” (Superlatives)**

1.  **the highest/largest/greatest number/amount/figure of...**: Japan had **the highest number of** car exports.

10. **A was the primary..., with B and C being the next two largest**: Rice was **the primary** crop, **with** wheat and corn **being the next two largest**.

**B. 两者或多者对比 (Comparisons)**

1.  **A was higher/lower than B**: The figure for Canada **was higher than** that for Australia. (注意用 `that of` 来避免重复)
2.  **more ... than**: Germany produced **more** steel **than** France.
3.  **in contrast to / compared to**: **In contrast to** the high figures in Europe, the numbers in Africa were very low.
4.  **while/whereas**: The spending on food was $500, **while/whereas** the spending on transport was only $200.

6.  **twice/three times as much/many as**: The UK had **twice as many** university students **as** Australia.
7.  **respectively**: The figures for France and Germany were 2.1m and 2.5m, **respectively**.

### **第二部分：万能模板 (Universal Template)**

这个模板的核心是引导你进行**“逻辑分组”**，而不是流水账式地罗列数字。

---

**【段落一：引言 - 改写题目】**

The table provides statistics on `[在此处填入衡量的内容, e.g., the consumption of five different foods]` in `[在此处填入地点或背景, e.g., a particular European country]` in the years `[年份1]`, `[年份2]`, and `[年份3]`.

- **备选句式:**
  - The table compares `[在此处填入比较的类别, e.g., four countries]` in terms of `[在此处填入衡量的指标, e.g., their production of various goods]` for the year `[年份]`.

**【段落二：概述 - 总结最宏观、最显著的特征】**

Overall, it is clear that `[在此处填入最显著的特征1，通常是最高项, e.g., Category A consistently had the highest figures throughout the period]`. Furthermore, `[在此处填入最显著的特征2，可以是最低项、总体趋势或最大差距, e.g., Category B showed a clear upward trend, while the opposite was true for Category C / there was a vast difference in the figures for X and Y]`.

- **提示:** 概述段要从“全局”出发，找出表格中最显眼的 1-2 个规律。可以是“谁是第一”，可以是“总体都升了/降了”，也可以是“贫富差距巨大”。

**【段落三：主体段一 - 聚焦关键类别（如最高、最低项）】**

Focusing on the most significant category, `[在此处填入最高项的名称]`, its figure stood at `[数据]` in `[年份1]`, and remained the highest throughout the period, ending at `[数据]` in `[年份3]`. In stark contrast, `[在此处填入最低项的名称]` registered the lowest numbers, starting at a mere `[数据]` and finishing at a slightly higher `[数据]`.

- **技巧:** 把“最大”和“最小”放在一起写，形成鲜明对比，这是最简单也最有效的写法。

**【段落四：主体段二 - 聚焦其他有共性的类别或趋势】**

Looking at the remaining categories, `[在此处填入类别B]` and `[在此处填入类别C]` showed similar patterns. The former began at `[数据]` and ended at `[数据]`, while the latter's figures were `[数据]` and `[数据]` in the first and last years respectively. The only category that demonstrated a clear downward trend was `[在此处填入呈下降趋势的类别]`, whose number fell from `[数据]` to `[数据]` over the `[X]`-year period.

- **技巧:** 寻找“相似的”或“有共同趋势的”类别，将它们打包描述。如果有一个类别趋势很特别（比如大家都在涨，只有它在跌），一定要单独拿出来强调。
